# JuliaSet

The Julia set is a mathematical set named after the French mathematician Gaston Julia. It is associated with complex dynamics, a field within the study of complex numbers and their behavior under iteration.

In the context of the Julia set, you start with a complex number and iterate a function. The set consists of points in the complex plane for which the iteration does not diverge to infinity. The Julia set is often visualized in fractal patterns, and its shape depends on the specific function used in the iteration.

I used Java GUI elements to implement this virtually.
